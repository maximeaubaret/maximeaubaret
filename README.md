### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™ve been working professionaly for 10+ years as a software engineer. During that time, I co-founded 2 startups as CTO. This allowed me to gain experience on a wide variety of technical topics.

I graduated in 2014 with an engineering degree in Computer Science from ENSEIRB-MATMECA in Bordeaux.

In 2009, I placed 11th in the WorldSkills Competition in Calgary, Canada in the IT/Software category, after earning the gold medal in France.

I've had the opportunity to work on a wide variety of projects. Lately I've been focused on building web and mobile apps in React / React-Native. Prior to that, I've built apps for iOS and Android in their respective languages. I've also worked on several projects in C/C++. I've also been interested as a hobby in reverse-engineering and other security-related topics.

I'm passionate about software development and I'm always looking for new challenges.
